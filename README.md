 <b>Structure</b>
 
 <p>Classes and ids</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Due to the simplicity of the webpage, applying CSS to semantic tags was deemed sufficient</li>
  <li>Classes have been added only when thereâ€™s a need to differentiate within a semantic element</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>:root</p>
 <ul>
  <li>This was used as it is the highest parent element available</li>
  <li>Means that if you change one variable, it is carried out across any class it is attributed. 
    This makes it quicker and more efficient to make changes.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>Comments</p>

  <li>Used across both html and css to help organise the content within the files</li>
  <li>Makes it easier to go back and edit later</li>
 </ul>
  
 <p>Media queries<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Used to specify changes to specific elements when the screen goes below a certain size</li>
    <li>Placed at the bottom of the css file to make it easier when going back and making changes</li>
  </ul>
  
  <b>Form</b>
  
<p>Hints and placeholder</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hints were used instead of placeholder text as it allows users to reference back rather than placeholder text which disappears once a user enters something in the field</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Hidden fields</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Users are asked to select a preferred contact method</li>
  <li>To make completing the form easier, only the preferred method input field will be shown</li>
